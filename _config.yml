  Hi, I my name is Akshit Grover. I am in my <mark>senior year</mark> of <mark>Computer Science</mark> at Vellore Institue of Technology, Vellore, India.
  I take pleasure in creating and building things. I make sure to spend my free time meditating. It is beneficial for maintaing a positive, radical and insightful mental attitude.
  I play guitar to stay positive and creative whenever under stress.
  
  I have been part of many student communities, All those teachings which I got from my seniors helped me take up and justify the responsibilities of <mark>Vice President Technical</mark> at ACM VIT Student Chapter and <mark>Docker Community Leader</mark>.

  Reading books is one exercise I like doing in my free time. It helps me to develop better focus and remain insightful.
  <br>My personal favorite topics are:
  - Lifestyle
  - Spirituality
  - Leadership 
  - Memoirs
  - Biographies  

  I consider myself a slave to humanity and whenever given an opportunity, I do my best to justify the role. I belive in the idea of <mark>Human for Human</mark>. The Sole purpose of our existence is to help others exist; Evolve and innovate collectively for the betterment of the future of existence.
